            <li>Submission links to the correct page</li>
            <p>The ITSC-3135 webpages site has a link to the Client Project page in the navigation bar.</p>
            <li>No spaces or uppercase in file/folder names (including images, scripts, css)</li>
            <p>There are no spaces or uppercase in the file/folder names in the GitHub repository.</p>
            <li>Design
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Sufficient contrast and readable font sizes</li>
                    <p>There is a good amount of contrast between the text and the background, and the text is an appropriate size. The footer and certain secitons use a light gray background which does not have enough contrast against the white background to stand out very much.</p>
                    <li>Consistent site colors and fonts using .css file</li>
                    <p>Consistent colors and fonts are used with separate CSS and JS files.</p>
                    <li>CRAP
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Contrast</li>
                            <p>The contrast between the text and background is good for readability. Contrast is also used between the headings and regular text with headings being larger and bolder. Apart from this there is not much contrast between elements which hurts visual diversity.</p>
                            <li>Repetition</li>
                            <p>There is a consistent styling throughout the site with elements being styled in the same ways across pages.</p>
                            <li>Alignment</li>
                            <p>Alignment is good with most elements being aligned to the left with consistent margins.</p>
                            <li>Proximity</li>
                            <p>Promixity is used to keep related content together to help with organization and readability but some pages have a lot of white space making these pages feel empty overall.</p>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Page structure
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Header</li>
                    <p>There is a header on all pages that is styled consistently, containing the site name in an h1 element and a navigation bar.</p>
                    <li>Main</li>
                    <p>The main element contains the content of the page on each page, though an h1 is used on each page rather than an h2 which is not correct.</p>
                    <li>Footer</li>
                    <p>The footer is styled consistently on each page with copyright and credit to who build the page.</p>
                    <li>(Optional) main nav between header and main</li>
                    <p>The header contains the only navigation bar but I do not think another nav is necessary for this site since all pages can be navigated to easily from the header.</p>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Header has site/brand header with text in an h1
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Site/brand header with text in an h1</li>
                    <p>The header has an h1 element with the site name.</p>
                    <li>Page name is not included in the header</li>
                    <p>The page name is not in the header.</p>
                    <li>Difference between head, header, and heading understood</li>
                    <p>The difference between the head, header, and heading is understood. The head contains metadata, links and scripts, the header is the header of the page with the h1 with site name and navigation bar, and the headings are used to label differentsections of the page.</p>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Main starts with page name as h2 and does not include the name of site/brand</li>
            <p>Pages start improperly with the page name as an h1 rather than an h2. Though they do not include name of the site.</p>
            <li>Tagline/slogan present somewhere consistently</li>
            <p>There is no evident tagline or slogan on the site.</p>
            <li>Footer
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Menu/links</li>
                    <p>There are no links in the footer.</p>
                    <li>HTML validation link and validates</li>
                    <p>Accumulus is used on all pages and validates successfully.</p>
                    <li>CSS validation link and validates</li>
                    <p>Accumulus is used on all pages and validates successfully.</p>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Project‑specific requirements to date addressed</li>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Develop fully functional HTML and CSS code for a minimum of 5 pages.</li>
                    <p>There are 6 pages in total with each having functional HTML and CSS.</p>
                    <li>Entry or Home page</li>
                    <p>The home page contains a header, main, and footer with classes used, though some classes such as "main-container" seem redundant as from what I can tell the main element itself could just have the stylign applied to it.</p>
                    <li>Navigation bar</li>
                    <p>The navigation bar functions on all pages and is styled consistently.</p>
                    <li>4 Other Pages</li>
                    <p>The other pages are easily navigated to from the navigation bar and do have some content, but the "Research" page mostly has placeholder content.</p>
                </ol>
            <li>Other notes and suggestions</li>
            <p>I would recommend introducting more colors to the page as it is currently black, white, and a light gray in most places apart from the header where the buttons are blue. Adding more colors will help create more visual interest and contrast. Also introducting more types of elements apart from paragraphs and headings will help break up the content on the pages more, such as images. Also making the light gray for footers and certain sections darker would help differentiate it from the background. I would also recommend making it so the footers are at the bottom of the page since it is a little jarring to see the footers in the middle of the page sometimes. Apart from these things, filling out the content for each page will be the final touches to clearing up some of the white space and potentially adding more visual interest to the pages.</p>
