            <h3><a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/">Yale School of Art</a></h3>
            <p>This site is the wiki for the Yale School of Art. 
                It can be contributed to by any member of the Yale School of Art.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>C - Contrast</li>
                <li>R - Repetition</li>
                <li>A - Alignment</li>
                <li>P - Proximity</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This site does not have issues with contrast in colors, but it does have issues in contrast with shape.
                This is due to it's repeated square boxes for menus and text backgrounds making it difficult for anything to stand out.
            </p>
            <p>
                The site does have a general style for each element providing repetition, but some of this style overlaps with other elements,
                 such as both paragraphs and menus being boxes with a white to yellow gradient. This makes it hard to distinguish between the different element types.
                Their calendar element is an exception to this, with the element itself having repetition but being a drastically different style than the rest of the site, breaking uniformity.
            </p>
            <p>
                The site's alignment is generally to the left, but this varies with some menu items stacked to the right of other text at varying areas.
                This creates a look of inconsistent alignment on the right side, with everything feeling out of place unless it is the few items on the very left side.
                This also creates a lot of blank space on the right side of the page.
            </p>
            <p>
                The biggest violation of proximity is the calendar element, with a list of things coming up, and then significantly lower on the pages
                is a different section labelled "Calendars & Newsletters" which would be related to the calendar.
            </p>

            <h3><a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple</a></h3>
            <p>This site is the main website for Apple. It provides a place to view and purchase Apple products and services.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>C - Contrast</li>
                <li>R - Repetition</li>
                <li>A - Alignment</li>
                <li>P - Proximity</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This site has good contrast, with every item standing out from its background.
                The site generally uses the colors black and white for text and background,
                but also uses a blue for buttons that pop out on the white or black background.
                Shapes are also used to create contrast, with buttons being rounded verses the generally
                rectangular shapes of the rest of the site.
            </p>
            <p>
                The site clearly follows repetition with buttons being very uniform in style and size,
                and various elements showcasing their items having a uniform style of header with item name,
                a short description, buttons to learn more and purchase, and then an image.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alignment is very clear, with a generally centered and symmetrical alignment of the elements.
                This makes the page feel very organized and also does not have any space that feels wasted.
            </p>
            <p>
                Proximity makes sense, with more popular products being towards the top and less popular ones being towards the bottom.
                Each of these items has their corresponding learn more and purchase buttons as well as descriptions and images. The products are also grouped
                and their services such as Apple TV and Apple Music being in their own section.
