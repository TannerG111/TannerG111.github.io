        <h3>Interactivity Inspiration/References</h3>
        <p>
            The dynamic functionality of this website will include a contact form that will accept information from the user so they can easily contact the hotel,
            and a gallery that can have images clicked on to enlarge and navigate through the gallery for user convenience to view the images in a larger format.
             The contact form will be used in the contact page and likely the home page as well. The gallery will be used in the gallery page and the navigation piece will be utilized in the home page as well.
