            <li>Submission links to the correct page
                <p>There is no link to the Client Project page in the navigation bar of the ITSC-3135 webpages site.</p>
            </li>
            <li>No spaces or uppercase in file/folder names (including images, scripts, css)
                <p>There are spaces in the file/folder names in the GitHub repository.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Design
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Sufficient contrast and readable font sizes
                        <p>The contrast between the text and the background is sufficient, and the text is an appropriate size.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Consistent site colors and fonts using .css file
                        <p>CSS files are used to style the site consistently for both colors and fonts.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>CRAP
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Contrast
                                <p>Contrast is colors makes text readable, and contrast between headings and text size helps them stand out. Interactive parts such as buttons also stand out with different shapes and colors. I think some more contrast could be implemented with a unique color for certain elements or sections to help break up the pages as currently everything appears to be white or a shade of green. Also the "Learn CSS with Angel" section on the index page has a light green background on the normal white background which I do not think has enough contrast to stand out from the background.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Repetition
                                <p>There is a clear design scheme for the site, with the same colors and fonts used throughout the site. Elements are also formatted in a consistent manner, with the same padding and margins used throughout the site for elemtns such as paragraphs and similar sections.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Alignment
                                <p>For the most part elements are aligned to the left giving a clear feeling of organization and alignment, with appropriate margins and padding to keep alignment but add visual interest. There are a couple of elements that are centered such as the "Learn CSS with Angel" section on the index page and the animated block on the "Animations" page which feel out of place due to the other elements being left aligned.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Proximity
                                <p>The proximity of elements is good with related content being grouped together and other content being separated with headings. There is a lot of white space on some pages due to a lack of content, also causing the footer to be in the middle of the page which is not visually appealing.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>

            <li>Page structure
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Header
                        <p>The header is consistent on all pages with an h1 for the site name and links to the other pages.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Main
                        <p>There is a main element that contains the main content of the page. The index page though has an h1 in the main and the header which I believe is not correct.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Footer
                        <p>The footer looks correct with references, copyright, and page title within it. The footer is missing on the "Layout and Positioning" page. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>(Optional) main nav between header and main
                        <p>The only nav is in the header but I believe this is sufficient for this site as it provides clear and easy navigation to the other pages.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Header has site/brand header with text in an h1
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Site/brand header with text in an h1
                        <p>There is a site header with the site name in an h1.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Page name is not included in the header
                        <p>The page name is not included in the header.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Difference between head, header, and heading understood
                        <p>The head, header, and heading are all used properly. The head contains metadata, links and scripts, the header is the header of the page containing the h1 with site name and navigation bar, and the headings are used to label sections of the page.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Main starts with page name as h2 and does not include the name of site/brand
                <p>Most pages have an h2 with the page name but the index page has an h1 with the page name. </p>
            </li>
            <li>Tagline/slogan present somewhere consistently
                <p>The only text that may be intended to be the tagline would be the site name "Learn CSS with Angel" that appears on every page but I do not believe this counts as a tagline.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Footer
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Menu/links
                        <p>The footer does not have any links to other pages.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>HTML validation link and validates
                        <p>Accumulus is used on the index page but no other pages, though it is successful on the index page.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>CSS validation link and validates
                        <p>Accumulus is used on the index page but no other pages, though it is successful on the index page.</p>

                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Project‑specific requirements to date addressed
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Develop fully functional HTML and CSS code for a minimum of 5 pages.
                        <p>The site does have functional HTML and CSS code for 7 pages and keeps the css and js in separate files.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Entry or Home page
                        <p>The header, main, and footer are all used with appropriate class and id usage. Content is also in this page.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Navigation bar
                        <p>The navigation bar is consistent in style and position and is used on all pages, with the links working properly for all pages</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>4 Other Pages
                        <p>Other pages are implemented with content and they have relevant names for their files.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Other notes and suggestions
                <p>My main suggestion would be to find a little more content to add to each page as some pages have a lot of empty space, and this opens up the opportunity to create more visual diversity to break up the pages. I really like the interactive elements to show off CSS tools, it is very engaging and unique.</p>
